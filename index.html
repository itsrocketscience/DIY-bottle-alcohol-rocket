<p>you will need:
  1 bottle, 5-10 ml of any alcohol, a lighter, a screwdriver or something to make a hole with
  </p>
<p>now fill the bottle up with the alcohol, shake it for 1-5 minutes</p>
<p>empty the alcohol from the bottle(to prevent any flamethrowing action)</p>
<p>poke a hole trough the bottle cap (2mm will work best)</p>
<p>light it up and watch it zoom!</p>

<h1>how it works:</h1>
<img src="268835ee-ab30-4e61-b263-4419130def45.png" alt="picture">
<p>the alcohol vapor from shaking the bottle ignites, the gas expands out, it has no where to go except out the small hole of the bottle, creating a fast strong burst of air.
The fire from the already ignited gas also expands back and creates a chain reaction of igniting the vapor behind and wooshing out</p>
