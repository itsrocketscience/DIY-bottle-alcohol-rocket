<p>The "woosh bottle" is a very safe rocket made for education about forces, the most common woosh bottle consists of a two liter bottle, and a alcohol and air mixture, it is then
  attached to a straw rail to stableize it when launched, it is much safer than solid rockets but is less practical for higher flights, i recomend to use %70 rubbing alcohol, but it 
  wont matter as you will be pouring all the liquid out, the less the percentage the longer you have to shake it for, exposing it to warm air can speed up the evaporation, make sure 
  after you can smell some of the alcohol, but msot importantly open the lid to get some air in for a much more powerful woosh!</p>
<p>you will need:
  1 bottle, 5-10 ml of any alcohol, a lighter, a screwdriver or something to make a hole with
  </p>
<p>now fill the bottle up with the alcohol, shake it for 1-5 minutes</p>
<p>empty the alcohol from the bottle(to prevent any flamethrowing action)</p>
<p>poke a hole trough the bottle cap (2mm will work best)</p>
<p>light it up and watch it zoom!</p>

<h1>how it works:</h1>
<img src="268835ee-ab30-4e61-b263-4419130def45.png" alt="picture">
<p>the alcohol vapor from shaking the bottle ignites, the gas expands out,</p>
<br>
<p>it has no where to go except out the small hole of the bottle, creating a fast strong burst of air.</p>
<br>
<p>The fire from the already ignited gas also expands back and creates a chain reaction of igniting the vapor behind and wooshing out</p>
